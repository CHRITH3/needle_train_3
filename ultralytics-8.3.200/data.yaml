# Needle Pose Dataset for YOLO11-pose
# Example usage: yolo pose train data=data.yaml model=yolo11s-pose.pt

# Dataset root directory
path: datasets

# Train/val/test sets
train: images/train  # 175 images
val: images/val      # 21 images
test: images/test    # 23 images

# Keypoints configuration
kpt_shape: [2, 3]  # [number of keypoints, dimensions] - 2 keypoints with x,y,visibility

# Flip indices for data augmentation (swap keypoints when horizontally flipped)
# Since needle tip and needle eye should swap when flipped
flip_idx: [1, 0]

# Keypoint names
kpt_names:
  0:
    - needle_tip   # keypoint 0: tip of the needle
    - needle_end   # keypoint 1: eye of the needle
